class Animal {
  void eat() {
    System.out.println("eating...");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  void bark() {
    System.out.println("barking...");
  }
}

class BabyDog extends Dog {
  void weep() {
    System.out.println("weeping...");
  }
}

class TestInheritance2 {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    BabyDog d = new BabyDog();
    Animal a = new Animal();
    d.weep();
    d.bark();
    d.eat();
  }
}

There are a few issues with this inheritance hierarchy:

1.Animal class does not have a bark() or weep() method, so lines 15 and 16 will produce a compilation error.
2.Animal class cannot be used to instantiate Dog or 'BabyDog' objects, so line 12 is correct but line 13 should be removed.
3.'a' is an Animal object, so it does not have access to Dog or 'BabyDog' methods, so lines 15 and 16 should be removed.
4.'BabyDog' inherits 'bark()' method from Dog, which can be called using 'BabyDog' objects, but Animal does not have access to it, so line 18 should be corrected to 'd.bark()'.
